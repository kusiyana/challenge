# challenge

This is a set of sripts for answering the Totvs data challenge. The folder here contains the following files:

1. basics.py - this contains simple code that outlines the nature of the challenge.json data set
2. new-customers.py - this is designed to calculate the number of new sign ups per month. It's a cumbersome procedure which I didn't optimise, owing to the time constraint available for doing the challenge
3. challenge.py - this contains code required to answer the questions posed in the challenge 
4. mlhayden.py - some basic functions used by other scripts
